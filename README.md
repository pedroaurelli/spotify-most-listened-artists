# Spotify - Discover the artists you've listened to the most this month

My first project consuming Spotify API, that was developmented and prototyped by myself. I used this project to learn about some concepts that i use day by day, and learn more about fetch external APIs and OAuth 2.0.
>This project was carried out for educational purposes, it has no lucrative intention.

## User data tratament
No! The collected data is NOT being saved in any database. Rest assured!

### üìú I¬¥m not in whitelist.
No problem! Unfortunately the Spotify API is quite bureaucratic, and only 25 users can access the application to consume the API in [DEVELOPMENT MODE](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/guides/development-extended-quota-modes/). Contact me by [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pedro-aureliano/) to give the access

## Conclusion and Lessons
At the beginning of the project, I had a few steps, such as raising the requirements, architecting the use cases and mainly reading the Spotify documentation to understand how authentication worked. In this project, I learned about OAuth2.0 and a little more about canva in html, with the html2Canva library.
